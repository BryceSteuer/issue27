              <h3>Plagiarism - The Final Word</h3>
              <p>Pagiarism is going wild on Khan Academy - literally. Classic coders whose programs have been forgotten are now being copied, the plagiarizers thinking nobody will find out. One such instance can be found <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-drawing-more-shapes-with-code/5012005863391232">here</a>. Now, luckily we have alert member of the community who are watchful for these things, but that is not always so. Many users figure that they can climb to success by skipping the steps of learning and hard work and instead take the easy way by building up a reputation with stolen code. This will not pay off, and if you or anyone you know is doing this, please stop or tell them to stop, for their own good and for the good of all the other members of this community.<br />Yours truly, <br />Bryce S.<br><br>Feel free to onform me of your opinion in the Tips and Thanks below.</p>

Even though the graphics are not the game's best side, the gameplay, transitions, and overall clean feel of the game make up for this. The point of this Python-coded platformer is simple - get as far as possible by switching walls to avoid oncoming obstacles that may disrupt your progress. There are many things to <i>look</i> for as well as <i>look out</i> for, including "pups" which will move you up levels, as well as coins which increase your score. Overall, the pros outweigh the cons in this classic Python game. This game was rated by The Programming Times:<br><b>Complexity</b>: 6.75/10<br><b>Fun:</b> 9.25/10<br><b>Graphics:</b> 4.5/10<br><b>Effects/Transitions</b>: 7.75/10</p><br><h2>Other reviews</h2>

In this game, as the title portrays, you must escape the prison: however, this is not easy and leads to hours of gaming through the twenty-five levels. Each level brings new treacherous dangers, including acid and lava, making it more difficult to reach the end portal and clear the level. The graphics are amazing for a platformer, and the transitions are pretty well done. The only downside is the lag, which may be too much for older browsers.

    <h2>About The Programming Times</h2>
    <h3>The Purpose</h3><p>The purpose of The Programming Times is to provide the Khan Academy programming community with reliable news and keep users up-to-date with the latest programs and events. At the time of founding, The Programming Times was the only newspaper doing this. Now that there are many other newspapers, this need is not as pertinent.</p>
    <h3>The History</h3><p> The Programming Times was founded on January 4, 2018 by Bryce S. The first issue was released the following weekend. It racked in only five viewers, a start of obscurity. Now, The Programming Times is Khan Academy's longest running newspaper. No other Khan Academy newspaper has gotten to 25 issues. Over the months, The Programming Times has achieved quite a prestigious name as a deliverer of reliable news.<h3>A "one man show"</h3><p>The Programming Times was founded and continues to be ran by one person and only one - Bryce S. Please be lenient if you do not get an issue when promised, as running a weekly newspaper and doing the website design for it is a bit overwhelming. I do not accept sponsors; however, if you would like to post the latest issue on your subscription page, feel free.</p><h3>Contact</h3><p>You can contact The Programming Times on Khan Academy weekdays from 3pm to 5pm Central Standard Time on Khan Academy.

  <p><b>The Programming Times:</b> Why did you learn to code? </p>
  <p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kaid_420312059609935963834774/discussion">Sy</a>:  I started learning how to code after I got a 3D printer and wanted to know how the printer took commands from the user.</p>
  <p> <b>The Programming Times</b>: How long did it take you to learn?</p>
  <p>Sy: 7 and a half months to where I am now.</p>
  <p><b>TPT</b>:  What do you think is your best program?</p>
  <p>Sy: Color Cube by far as the joystick is a masterpiece (to me) alone.</p>
  <p> <b>TPT</b>:  Do you have any advice for people who want to learn?</p>
  <P>Sy: Try to learn from advanced programs to help you grasp a better understanding of a topic such as OOP.</p>
  <p><b>TPT:</b> What program is your favorite?</p>
  <p>Sy: Hmmâ¦probably KWCâs Memory Card game.</p>
  <p><b>TPT</b>:  Anything else you want to include, i.e. shoutouts?</p>
  <p>Sy: Shoutout to Non-pirate for helping me learn more and more about code along the way!</p>
  <p><b>TPT:</b> Who are your favorite Programmers?</p>
  <p>Sy: KWC and To13 would be my favorite programmers.</p>
